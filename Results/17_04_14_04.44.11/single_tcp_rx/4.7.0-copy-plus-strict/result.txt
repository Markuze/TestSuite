 Processor Counter Monitor: Memory Bandwidth Monitoring Utility  ($Format:%ci ID=%h$)

 This utility measures memory bandwidth per channel or per DIMM rank in real-time

Number of physical cores: 28
Number of logical cores: 28
Number of online logical cores: 28
Threads (logical cores) per physical core: 1
Num sockets: 2
Physical cores per socket: 14
Core PMU (perfmon) version: 3
Number of core PMU generic (programmable) counters: 8
Width of generic (programmable) counters: 48 bits
Number of core PMU fixed counters: 3
Width of fixed counters: 48 bits
Can not access CPUs Model Specific Registers (MSRs).
Try to execute 'modprobe msr' as root user and then
you also must have read and write permissions for /dev/cpu/*/msr devices (/dev/msr* for Android). The 'chown' command can help.
Access to Processor Counter Monitor has denied (no MSR or PCI CFG space access).
